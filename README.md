## Overview

**EmbedAI** is an academic project that facilitates the development and testing of STM32 code.

Our solution is a smart platform designed to assist developers in writing, analyzing, and improving STM32 code. It consists of two main components:

- A **web application** that supports intelligent code analysis and learning tools.
- A **Visual Studio Code (VS Code) extension** tailored to enhance different stages of the STM32 development workflow.
.

##Features

**WEB Application**

The web application allows users to either write code manually or upload STM32 code files. Once submitted, the code is compiled using Clang, enabling the detection of syntax errors and bugs, with information on the exact line and
type of error, helping users better understand and address the issues.
After analysis, users can:
• Download a detailed PDF report containing results and suggestions.
• View statistical insights about error types and frequency.
• Track their history of code analysis sessions for review and learning.
